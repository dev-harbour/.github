Harbour is an open-source software development toolkit for creating multi-platform GUI and console applications. It is compatible with the xBase programming language, which is the language behind popular database management systems such as dBase, FoxPro, and Clipper. Harbour provides a modernized version of the xBase language and includes additional features such as support for Unicode, 64-bit integers, and object-oriented programming. It also includes a built-in macro compiler, a cross-platform GUI library, and a set of standard libraries for tasks such as string manipulation, file I/O, and database access. Harbour can be used to develop applications for Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms, making it a versatile choice for software development projects.

Historical Review
</p></h3>

#### xBase
<p align="justify">
xBase is a programming language that was first developed in the early 1980s. It is the language behind popular database management systems such as dBase, FoxPro, and Clipper. The language was designed to be simple and easy to use, making it accessible to a wide range of programmers, including those with little or no prior programming experience.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The first xBase language was dBase II, created by Wayne Ratliff in 1979 as a simple database program that ran on CP/M computers. In the following year, Ratliff created dBase III and it was a commercial success and widely used in the early 1980s. dBase III is the first widely adopted database management system. As a result, it was the first widely adopted xBase dialect. dBase III was a success and it was widely adopted by businesses and other organizations, becoming one of the most popular database management systems of the time.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The popularity of dBase led to the creation of several other xBase-based languages, including FoxBase and FoxPro. FoxBase was a programming language and development environment for MS-DOS, developed by Fox Software. Later on, in 1989, Microsoft acquired Fox Software and released FoxPro for Windows. FoxPro was a more advanced version of FoxBase and was widely used in the early 1990s.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Another popular xBase-based language was Clipper, developed by Nantucket Corporation. It was widely used in the early 1990s, particularly in the field of accounting and financial management software. Clipper was designed to be a more efficient and powerful version of dBase and was often used in the development of large and complex applications.
</p>

<p align="justify">
xBase languages reached its peak of popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s but it started losing popularity as other programming languages such as C, C++ and Visual Basic came to market. Nowadays, is not widely used, but Harbour, an open-source compiler, is trying to keep alive the development in xBase language by allowing the use of new features and possibilities in modern systems, as well as providing compatibility with the old code.
</p>

#### Clipper
<p align="justify">
Clipper is an xBase-based programming language that was first developed in the 1980s by Nantucket Corporation. It was designed to be a more efficient and powerful version of dBase, the first widely adopted xBase dialect.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The development of Clipper began in 1985, by Roger Sippl and Ken Franqueiro, who were former employees of Ashton-Tate, the company that had developed dBase. They started the company Nantucket, and Clipper was their first product. Clipper was designed to address some of the limitations of dBase and other xBase languages, such as the lack of support for compiling and the inability to handle large amounts of data. Clipper was among the first languages to introduce the concept of a "compiler", which is a program that converts the source code of a program into machine-readable code. This allowed Clipper applications to run faster and be more efficient than their interpreted counterparts.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Clipper was first released in 1987, and it quickly gained popularity among businesses and other organizations, particularly in the field of accounting and financial management software. Clipper was one of the first languages to provide native support for a database engine, which made it a powerful tool for creating and managing databases. It also had a rich set of libraries and functions, which allowed developers to create sophisticated applications with minimal effort.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Clipper also introduced many features that were not present in other xBase languages at that time, like the support for object-oriented programming and the ability to create multi-platform applications. Clipper was available for several platforms including MS-DOS, Macintosh and Unix.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Clipper's popularity reached its peak in the early 1990s, however, with the advent of Windows and other new programming languages such as Visual Basic and Delphi, its popularity started to decline. Nantucket was bought by Computer Associates in the mid-90s and the development of Clipper stopped.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Despite this, Clipper continues to be used by some developers today, especially those working with legacy systems. Clipper was a powerful and widely-used language in its time, and its influence can still be seen in today's programming languages, particularly in the use of xBase-style languages.
</p>

#### Harbour
<p align="justify">
The Harbour programming language is an open-source software development toolkit that was created as a modern version of the xBase programming language, which is the language behind popular database management systems such as dBase, FoxPro, and Clipper.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The development of Harbour started in 1999, by Antonio Linares, a programmer from Spain, who wanted to create an open-source version of the Clipper programming language. Harbour was designed to be compatible with existing xBase code and to provide a modernized version of the xBase language, with additional features such as support for Unicode, 64-bit integers, and object-oriented programming.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The first version of Harbour was released in 2000, and it quickly gained popularity among developers looking to work with xBase-style languages. One of the key features of Harbour is its built-in macro compiler, which allows developers to create highly optimized code that runs faster and consumes less memory than interpreted code.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Harbour also includes a cross-platform GUI library and a set of standard libraries for tasks such as string manipulation, file I/O, and database access, these standard libraries make Harbour easier to use and help developers to create sophisticated applications with minimal effort.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Over time, Harbour has been improved and extended, it has support for Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms, making it a versatile choice for software development projects. In 2009 Harbour was substantially redesigned, mainly by Viktor Szakáts and Przemysław Czerpak.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In summary, Harbour is an open-source software development toolkit that was created in 1999 as a modern version of the xBase programming language, with a goal of being compatible with existing xBase code while also providing additional features such as support for Unicode, 64-bit integers, and object-oriented programming. It was first released in 2000 and quickly gained popularity among developers looking to work with xBase-style languages. It includes a built-in macro compiler, a cross-platform GUI library and a set of standard libraries, making it easier to use and versatile choice for software development projects. It supports several platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, and others.
